    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These roasted mushrooms are perfect if you're hoping to transform bland mushrooms into a flavorful side dish! My favorite way to serve these is with a juicy grilled ribeye. You can use any oven-proof skillet or dish; use a size that's just big enough to fit all the mushrooms.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound fresh white mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Clean mushrooms with a damp paper towel and gently remove and discard stems.</li>
        <li>Drizzle oil into a large cast iron skillet to evenly coat. Place mushrooms into the skillet, cap-side down. Carefully sprinkle garlic into the mushroom cavities, taking care not to sprinkle directly into the skillet. Drizzle mushrooms with melted butter, then season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and return to the oven for 3 to 5 more minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with parsley. Let cool slightly before serving.</li>
    </ol>
